FormBuilder-Android
===================
This repository contains the Android SDK that allows you to render forms produced by [Vertis](http://www.vertisinfotech.com)' fork of [formbuilder](https://github.com/dobtco/formbuilder) within an Android App. The fork of the formbuilder (the coffeescript code) itself will be open-sourced soon and a link will be published here.

This repository has two components:
## formbuilder-android
This is the SDK source code, in the form of an Eclipse project. If you are developing an android app to render forms, you'd need to add this as a dependency in your Android App project (i.e. your project will depend on this project to render forms).
## formbuilderDemo
This is a sample (and simple) android app built using the above SDK.
